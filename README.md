# BerryMed
In this project, I have utilized the Bluetooth communication protocols of Berry med (with and without ECG) to transfer the heart rate, SpO2, and their waveforms to the webpage directly from Bluetooth, such a method can be used to directly upload the data to the database.
In order to make this code work, you must enable bluetooth communication in google chrome and enable development mode in google chrome.
